Hi, I am Selena Ge, a researcher at [HalicioÄŸlu Data Science Institute (HDSI)](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/), [University of California, San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/) Causality lab, under the supervision of [Prof. Biwei Huang](https://biweihuang.com/). I am currently a Master's student of Data Science at UCSD. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from [New York University (NYU)](https://nyu.edu/), Shanghai campus.

My research interests include Reinforcement Learning, Diffusion Models, Stochastic Differential Equations, and Causality. I am currently working on several research projects about advancing AI's capacity to uncover latent dynamics and learn causal representations by addressing real-world data complexities and leveraging active interventions. This improves decision-making in Reinforcement Learning, enables more robust Causal Discovery, and enhances the reasoning and control capabilities of large-scale pre-trained models.
